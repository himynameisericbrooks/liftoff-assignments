# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    This project will be an application to help musicians track their practice, progress and learning materials. I have been a musician for 15 years. During that time I have worked on hundreds of songs, exercises, scales, transcriptions and concepts. I love music of many different genres and I try to learn to play any instrument that I can get my hands on. Because of this, I have a lot of books, binders, loose pieces of paper, youtube playlists, google drive documents, pdfs, voice memos and memorized material that I have practiced or that I would like to practice, but I often can't find the exact resource that I want to work from because keeping all of that organized is difficult.
This app would allow its users to create an account and quickly make a page to represent each practice idea that they want to keep track of. While on the page for a particular practice idea, the user would be able to see and edit the name of the idea, a description of the idea, any notes they have added, the tempo/bpm, the date of the last time they practiced it and a comfortablility/mastery rating. I also hope to add options to upload pdfs, mp3s, and integrate spotify and youtube so users can easily add songs and videos to their practice ideas.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have be able to access and track their own specific materials.
Crud Practice Ideas: Users will be able to create, retrieve, update and delete practice idea pages for each practice idea that they would like to track and store.
Search: Users will be able to search their content to quickly navigate to individual practice ideas.
Tag: The user will be able to add tags to their practice ideas so they can quickly find their content and group related content.

### Technologies
C#
.Net Core
SQL
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to build an application from scratch and how to integrate all of the above technologies together in a project that is not already laid out for me. I also want to make sure this application looks presentable so I hope to learn a lot about using css and bootstrap inside a C# web application,
